### Quick Start

You will need to [install CocoaPods](http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html) and then run the following steps to checkout the project and install the dependencies.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/apiaryio/polls-app
$ cd polls-app
$ pod install
$ open Polls.xcworkspace
```

### Architecture

This application uses the [MVVM (Model View View-Model)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_ViewModel) software architecture. Where each view controller has an appropriate view model which contains all of the model logic. The view model in this case will encapsulate the logic required to communicate to the API.

The Polls application is constructed from three view controllers and view models:

- Question List - Shows a list of questions and may allow the user to create a new question or view the detail of a question.
- Question Detail - Shows a specific question, and may allow a user to vote on the choices available on a question.
- Create Question - Allows the user to create a new question in the API.

#### API Root

The Polls iOS client can be configured to use any API root, or switch
between connecting to a Hypermedia API or the JSON Polls API described
via an API Blueprint. You can switch between these modes by shaking
the device (^âŒ˜Z in the simulator).

Defaults:

- Hypermedia: `https://polls.apiblueprint.org/` - A hosted version of a Hypermedia Polls API.
- API Blueprint: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apiaryio/polls-app/master/apiary.apib` - An API Blueprint found at this URL (hosted on GitHub in this repository).
- Apiary: `pollsapp` - An API Blueprint hosted on Apiary.
